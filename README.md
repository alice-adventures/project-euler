# Alice / Project Euler

> **Alice** : *Adventures for Learning and Inspiring Coding Excellence*

## Introduction

The Project Euler repository contains a collection of tools to develop
solutions for problems from Project Euler, a website dedicated to
mathematical and computational problem-solving.

These problems are a great way to practice algorithm design, coding skills,
and explore the capabilities of the Alice platform. To get started, simply
visit the [Alice wiki](https://github.com/alice-adventures/Alice/wiki) and
follow the Getting Started tutorial.

Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
